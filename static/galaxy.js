// Lightweight canvas galaxy background inspired by provided React OGL shader example.
// This version avoids React/JSX and external build tooling; no dependencies.
// It renders a starfield with subtle motion and parallax behind the main content.

// galaxy.js retired: previously implemented canvas starfield. Intentionally left blank.
// Keeping stub so any lingering script tags won't error.
